        - Overall Assessment: ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ (3/5)
        
        ## Critical Issues
        
        1. Potential security vulnerability at line 57
           - Issue: Unvalidated user input passed directly to SQL query
           - Fix: Use parameterized queries or an ORM
           - Severity: High
           
        2. Resource leak at line 89
           - Issue: File stream not closed in all execution paths
           - Fix: Use try-with-resources or ensure close in finally block
           - Severity: Medium
        
        ## Code Style Issues
        
        1. Inconsistent naming convention at lines 23, 45, 78
           - Use camelCase for method names as per project convention
           
        2. Method at line 102 exceeds 50 lines
           - Consider breaking into smaller methods
        
        ## Positive Aspects
        
        1. Good test coverage for new feature
        2. Clear comments and documentation
        3. Efficient algorithm implementation in SortUtil
        
        ## Suggestions for Improvement
        
        1. Add more defensive null checks
        2. Consider caching the results of expensive operations
        3. Extract configuration to properties file
