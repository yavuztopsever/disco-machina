## Recent Updates

The documentation has been updated with several significant improvements to the system flows and architecture:

### 1. CrewAI Integration Enhancements

- Integrated all relevant CrewAI features for maximum performance and capability
- Added built-in CrewAI tools (BraveSearchTool, CodeDocsSearchTool, etc.) to each agent
- Enhanced agent configuration with memory and delegation capabilities
- Implemented step callbacks for detailed progress tracking

### 2. WebSocket Implementation for Real-time Updates

- Added WebSocket support to the server for real-time job status updates
- Created a WebSocket connection manager to handle multiple connections
- Implemented fallback to polling when WebSockets are unavailable
- Added progress tracking with visual indicators

### 3. Enhanced Error Recovery

- Implemented exponential backoff retry mechanism for failed tasks
- Added critical path analysis to handle task failures appropriately
- Improved error reporting and logging
- Implemented intelligent error recovery strategies

### 4. Task Checkpointing System

- Created a checkpointing system to save progress after each task
- Added ability to resume execution after interruptions
- Implemented checkpoint backup mechanism for increased safety
- Added logic to skip completed tasks on restart

### 5. Improved Documentation
